# Z31-Amplifier
New Amplifier that fits into stock Z31 Amplifier Housing
This isn't for the faint of heart.  This requires desoldering skills as the original header and DIN socket are reused.
It could use a few tweaks with spacing of the amplifier chips. They are off a little left or right. The footprints could also use a few tweaks as well. Works as is though. 
I originally thought the amplifier chips wouldn't fit inbetween the original metal mounting clamps.  They do but I was going to make an adapter out of aluminum to have it sink to the case. This spacing is rather large.  This spacing should be resolved if another version were to be made.
